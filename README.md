# Tools-For-OpenFOAM-Automation
As all Foamers know, OpenFOAM is top-tier CFD software. Nevertheless, 'ease-of-use' or even 'convenience' are words that normally do not come to mind when we speak about OpenFOAM. There are tools like pyFOAM that may achieve similar control over openFOAM, however, I wanted to do this on my own.
First of all, a good mesh is the most important input to OF. My personal mesher of choice is snappyHexMesh. There has been a lot said about sHM, I won't add to that. My experiences with it are mixed, but there is no open-source mesher that can handle multiregion or AMI better. So I have to deal with it. The problems I have with it are mostly with big meshes (5M+ cells) and the waiting time. Even with MPI and 32 cores, a waiting time of 1h+ is too long if you can't be sure your resulting mesh works. And that's the main problem with sHM: you never really can be with AMI because SHM is kind of stochastic (maybe there's a better word for it, IDK) regarding its results. What do I mean by that? Even with IDENTICAL snappyHexMeshDict, a second meshing run does not lead to exactly the same result. There are minor variations in the mesh, they are only 'kind of' the same.
